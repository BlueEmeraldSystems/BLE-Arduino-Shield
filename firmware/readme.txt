File list and Summary
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
attributes.txt    File generated by bgbuild
cdc.xml           Configuration file for USB Port
gatt.xml          Configuration file for GATT Services & Characteristics
hardware.xml      Configuration file for BLE112 hardware settings - UART Port, options, Baud Rate, timer, sleep mode etc
out-ble112.hex    Generated hex file to be loaded into the BLE112 module by 'bgupdate.exe'
project-ble112.bgproj Project file, used as input to the 'bgbuild.exe' build tool


Required tools
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Text or XML Editor - user supplied
* Bgbuild.exe - part of SDK from www.Bluegiga.com
* Bgupdate.exe - tool within SDK from www.Bluegia.com


Tool Usage:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build:
To build the firmware, 
* Open a command shell
* Enter 'bgbuild project-ble112.bgprog'
* Output file is 'out-ble112.hex'

Flash Loading:
To update firmware, run bgupdate.exe. 
* A user supplied flash loader is required. 
* The CC Debugger from Texas Insturments is the recomended loader.
* Cable Orientation: The cable should enter at the boards left edge, covering chip 'IC1'
* Set the file to be loaded to the path to 'out-ble112.hex'
* The Board may be programmed whild attached to an Arduino board.
  However, Digital Pin 4 must be configured as an input. Example code follows at the end of this document.
  
  If Pin 4 is configured as an output, the CC Debugger will show a 'Red LED' condition and will not update.
